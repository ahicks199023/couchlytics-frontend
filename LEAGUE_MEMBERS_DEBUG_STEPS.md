# 🔍 League Members Debug Steps

## Current Issue
The League Members tab is only showing 1 user (`antoinemariohickssales@gmail.com`) instead of all league members.

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check the Debug Panel
1. **Navigate to**: Commissioner Dashboard → League Management → League Members tab
2. **Look for**: The debug panel (should be visible now)
3. **Check**: 
   - API endpoint used
   - Response status
   - Number of users returned
   - Raw response data

### 2. Test API Endpoints Directly
Open browser console and run these commands:

```javascript
// Test the commissioner/users endpoint
fetch('https://api.couchlytics.com/leagues/12335716/commissioner/users', {
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Commissioner/users response:', data))

// Test the members endpoint
fetch('https://api.couchlytics.com/leagues/12335716/members', {
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Members response:', data))
```

### 3. Check Backend Logs
Look for these patterns in your backend logs:
- `GET /leagues/12335716/commissioner/users` - should show user count
- `GET /leagues/12335716/members` - should show member count
- Any database queries related to league membership

### 4. Verify League Membership
Check if other users are actually members of this league:
- Are they in the database as league members?
- Do they have the correct `league_id`?
- Are they active members?

## Expected Results
- **Commissioner/users endpoint**: Should return all users with commissioner access
- **Members endpoint**: Should return all league members
- **Debug panel**: Should show which endpoint was used and the response data

## Next Steps
1. Share the debug panel output
2. Share the console API test results
3. Check backend logs for user counts
4. Verify database membership records

## Possible Issues
1. **Backend filtering**: The endpoint might be filtering users incorrectly
2. **Database issue**: Users might not be properly linked to the league
3. **Permission issue**: The endpoint might only return users with specific roles
4. **Caching issue**: Old data might be cached

Let me know what you find in the debug panel and console tests!
