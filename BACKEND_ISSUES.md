# Backend Issues Requiring Fix

## ✅ Issue 1: Team ID Mismatch Between APIs - RESOLVED

**Status**: This issue has been resolved by the backend team.

**Previous Problem**: The frontend was displaying "Team 759955462" instead of actual team names because the leaderboard API and teams API returned different team ID formats.

**Resolution**: The backend team standardized the team ID format across both APIs, ensuring consistent team identifier fields.

## ✅ Issue 2: Player Name Column Error - RESOLVED

**Status**: This issue has been resolved by the backend team.

**Previous Problem**: 500 Internal Server Errors on player detail pages, players list, and trade tool pages due to `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column players.name does not exist`.

**Resolution**: 
1. **Fixed SQL queries** to use correct player name columns (`full_name` instead of `name`)
2. **Enhanced player detail API** to return comprehensive player data including:
   - All 47 Madden rating fields (speed, acceleration, awareness, etc.)
   - Complete contract information (cap release penalty, net savings)
   - Player biographical details (college, years pro, hometown, etc.)
   - Headshot and metadata fields

**Files Modified**: `routes/analytics_routes.py` - `get_player_details` function

**Result**: Player detail pages now display complete player information with all rating values and contract details.
